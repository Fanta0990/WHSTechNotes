trowing the drone around by using a code

My expirence with python has been amazing, ive always like typing in python regardless but its been fun to code this stuff! The most challnging thing about it is the organization especially if you make a mistake. If you make a mistake and its harder to fine the mistake. These fundementals would help make the code a lot simplier and easier to read and or understand. For example the For loop would make the code go on and on until it is told to stop allowing you to not copy and paste the same code a thousand times.

The reason why you should follow python instrutions step by step because there is only a few ways to write certain code and if you type it wrong nothing is going to happen in the code.

The Job im intrested in is Astronomy and its about studing celestial objects like Stars and planets. Its required you have a PH.D in Astronomy, Physics, or any related feilds also knowlage in math, writting, verbal speaking and problem solving. To increass the growth you can do training or networking sorces. This actually does not corilate with computer science to my knolage and to be honesty this is just stuff i wish to know

Coding can improve problem solving skills by trying to find out what is wrong and how to fix it in certain sensrios. Coding can inhance problem solving skills as said in the last question which could help solve diffrent problems outside of coding. Coding can inhance creativity by having the person creat new lines of code, making games, or making something like a robot to work the way they want to

Ai could be good for helping people do simple math problems and explaining it thoughly or to ask very simple questions that could help you fix something or be able to do something a lot simpliler. Ai could also be bad by making art instead of actual humans who have passions and dreams as well of taking jobs like art or Animation/ movies. There is more bad things about AI current day than good like in the past.

Technology can be a big part of the election like how Kamala harris are making memes for the election or how donald trump posted about working at mcdonalds. People are able to spread true or false informations about the people who are running as president and to be able to post the ralleies that happen to be anble to anaylze and pin point certain information.

It is important to make sure to secure your personal info because people are able to steal it and use it to their advatage and even sell it on the black market. Procotions you could make to secure your personal infromation is to not post it at all or censor it. You cant really take it back but you can delete it so nobody else can see it. Just not post anything to personal or make anything where personal information in your code.

The presidental election happened in our community and technology have failed us multiple times with the counter as an example. Currently we have to recount over 30,000 votes because some have burned, or the fact the counter just broke.
Technology could of been better if the machine did its job properly or if we had better secruity on the voting boxes.

Techonogy changes as we grow as we adapt to the world and we get more smarter and figuring how stuff works espically either ways to harvest. The more we use technology to do stuff like harvesting the less money we have to pay because we are not usuing manual labor.

The thing that concerns me about new technology is AI stealing jobs espically in the art industry.  A way to innovate Technology is to making it be able to have more things to help humans do the task at hand. Ethical things that should be considered would be AI being able to do stuff only humans should be doing or letting machines machines do all the manula work for people.

Brain rot is somthing that has a literal meaning, like your brain rotiting, or people who say stuff repeatively like the person is not fully there. Personally i find "brainrot" to be severally annoying. Media can have both a possitive and negitive influence on you mattering what you see on the internet, certain things that are inappropriate can affect a person negativly while something that makes you smile can effect you possitivly. Slop is a word i have never heard up but Lore have been a thing since 2018 saying that a story or a game has plot and or has plot that the person is is playing or reading needs to figure out. It is possible to balance meaningful engagement if you just control what you watch and or do on the internet.

Looking back - I enjoyed that we were able to code and the other people in this class are social
Looking Ahead - Some thing that would be intesting is talking about certain codes and ideas of codes and or games. I would like to explore adding photos and or animating in code.
Certifications - Im thinking to get certified in python, all i need to do is learn more about it and test myself

My opinon on this is taht it could be good in a way like being able to help humans with stuff but it can do bad just because it can take jobs and make things more artifical.To perpare myself i would to perpare for an ai takeover and get jobs that humans have to do
