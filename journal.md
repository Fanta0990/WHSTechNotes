My expirence with python has been amazing, ive always like typing in python regardless but its been fun to code this stuff! The most challnging thing about it is the organization especially if you make a mistake. If you make a mistake and its harder to fine the mistake. These fundementals would help make the code a lot simplier and easier to read and or understand. For example the For loop would make the code go on and on until it is told to stop allowing you to not copy and paste the same code a thousand times.

The reason why you should follow python instrutions step by step because there is only a few ways to write certain code and if you type it wrong nothing is going to happen in the code.
