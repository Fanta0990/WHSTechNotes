trowing the drone around by using a code

My expirence with python has been amazing, ive always like typing in python regardless but its been fun to code this stuff! The most challnging thing about it is the organization especially if you make a mistake. If you make a mistake and its harder to fine the mistake. These fundementals would help make the code a lot simplier and easier to read and or understand. For example the For loop would make the code go on and on until it is told to stop allowing you to not copy and paste the same code a thousand times.

Ai could be good for helping people do simple math problems and explaining it thoughly or to ask very simple questions that could help you fix something or be able to do something a lot simpliler. Ai could also be bad by making art instead of actual humans who have passions and dreams as well of taking jobs like art or Animation/ movies. There is more bad things about AI current day than good like in the past.
